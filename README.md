# AirPaint
 This Python code creates a virtual finger painting application using computer vision and hand tracking. Users can draw on a virtual canvas by moving their index finger, selecting different colors and clearing the canvas as needed. The code leverages OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand landmark detection, and NumPy for numerical operations.
